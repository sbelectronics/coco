Colorware Realtalker Schematics
http://www.smbaker.com/

NOTE! CAUTION! These schematics are unverified.

These directories contain reverse-engineered schematics for the
colorware realtalker for the trs-80 color computer. Note that the
version 1 of the realtalker was for coco-1 only as it relied on
the +12V from the cartridge port. A version-2 was added for the coco-2
which at a minimum included an external power supply. Unknown what
other changes the version-2 may have included.

Also present is a schematic for a revised version that I am working
on that will include a few minor improvements.
