Colorware Realtalker Schematics

NOTE! CAUTION! These schematics are unverified.

These directories contain reverse-engineered schematics for the
colorware realtalker for the trs-80 color computer. Note that the
version 1 of the realtalker was for coco-1 only as it relied on
the +12V from the cartridge port. A version-2 was added for the coco-2
which at a minimum included an external power supply. I also found
that the version-1 when used on a Coco-2 produces audio that is
clipped and distorted. Adding a potentiometer between the realtalker's
output and the coco's cartridge sound input resolved this issue for
me. Unknown what other changes the version-2 may have included.

Also present is a schematic for a revised version that I am working
on that will include a few minor improvements.
