Colorware Realtalker for the Tandy Color Computer

This subdirectory includes resources related to the colorware
RealTalker for the Tandy Color Computer. The RealTalker used
the Votrax SC-01-A speech IC.

Colorware made two versions of the Real Talker

* Version 1: For the coco-1. Received 12V from the internal
  cartridge slot.

* version 2: For the coco-2. Had a jack for powering the
  real talker from an external wall-wart (voltage unknown).

When using a version-1 on a coco-2 (with a multi-pak interface to
supply the +12V), I found that audio output was too high and was
clipped and distorted. I had to add a potentiometer between the
realtalker's output and the coco's input. I did this by hacking up
my MPI.
